### Probabilitiy

### Expected value

* trial (experiment) is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a
  well defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space
* if the sample space is finite, each possible number can be assigned a value
  between zero and one that corresponds to the likelihood of that particular
  outcome
* since every trial ends with exactly one outcome, the sumeof the probabilities
  associated with he outcomes is always one
* e.g. - a simple trial of the outcome of rolling a die once - 1/6 chance for
  any side
* a die is an example of uniformly distributed probability
* an event is a set of outcomes of a trial (a subset of the sample space) - e.g.
  rolling an even number {2, 4, 6} - probablity of the even is 50%
