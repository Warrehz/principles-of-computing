### Probability

### Basics

* a trial (experiment) is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a
  well defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space
* if the sample space is finite, each possible number can be assigned a value
  between zero and one that corresponds to the likelihood of that particular
  outcome
* since every trial ends with exactly one outcome, the sum of the probabilities
  associated with he outcomes is always one
* e.g. - a simple trial of the outcome of rolling a die once - 1/6 chance for
  any side
* a die is an example of uniformly distributed probability
* an event is a set of outcomes of a trial (a subset of the sample space) - e.g.
  rolling an even number {2, 4, 6} - probability of the even is 50%

### Expected value

* e.g. - in a CS program, 1/3 of the students have 2.0 GPA, 1/3 have 3.0, and 1/3 have 4.0.
  The expected value of GPA if one student was chosen at random is 3.0, the same as
  the mean (average).
* The expected value of rolling a dice is 3.5 - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6.
* The outcome has a 0 probability of being 3.5. Expected value is meant to be
  thought of in terms of average.
